% Notes:
%
% English is not an official language of Sweden. Nevertheless, an en_SE locale can be motivated by the following quote
% from Wikipedia:
%
%   There is currently an ongoing debate among linguists whether English should be considered a foreign language,
%   second language or transcultural language in Sweden (and other Scandinavian countries) due to its widespread
%   use in education and society in general.
%
% This locale definition aims to describe the typical conventions for the use of English by native Swedes.
%
% It retains the LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE definitions of sv_SE to allow for Swedish-native classification
% of the three Swedish-specific umlaut characters at the end of the alphabet, and to retain the Swedish-native
% sort order of V, W and these umlaut characters. This is relevant, for example, when sorting names.
%
% It uses the region-appropriate sv_SE declarations of LC_MONETARY, LC_PAPER, LC_TELEPHONE, LC_MEASUREMENT, and LC_NAME.
%
% It copies the declaration of LC_TIME from en_DK: the use of English names of the days of the week and the months,
% but using the region-appropriate date format derived from ISO 8601-1988 (e.g., 2024-08-22), and definition
% of week number (first_weekday 2).
%
% LC_NUMERIC is custom for the locale: the most common representation of numbers alongside English text in Sweden
% adopts the English decimal point (.) rather than the Swedish decimal comma (,), but retains the Swedish
% practice for the thousands separator of a narrow space rather than a comma, since the latter could cause confusion
% with the Swedish decimal notation.
%
% LC_ADDRESS uses the same data as sv_SE, except setting the lang_* settings to English.
